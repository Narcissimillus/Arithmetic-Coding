# Shannon-Fano algorithm
This is a simple implementation of arithmetic coding and decoding in C++. It includes an example file "data.in" structured as Color Symbol | Lower value of probability range | Higher value of probability range.

And for a user input like 6 W K K Y R B the coded value will be 0.43137.
